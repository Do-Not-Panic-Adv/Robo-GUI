# Library information 
The SDL2 bindings used require the original libraries to be installed manually, as the crates feature to perform this action automatically is not currently working.
On linux systems the 'sdl2', 'sdl2_image' and 'sdl2_ttf' packages need to be installed through a package manager. 
On MAC systems, the same packaes can be installed via brew with the commands 'brew install <package>'.
On Windows ( :sad_emoji ) please refer to https://github.com/Rust-SDL2/rust-sdl2#windows-msvc
